Simple Next.JS application to aggregate and display iCal url's feeds in a calendar. I primarily use it to aggregate my Sonarr/Radarr releases calendar in a more organized manner.

## Usage
 - make a `.env` file using the `.env.example` as a guideline
 - `npm install`
 - `npm run dev`

As simples as any application can be. For now..
